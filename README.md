WELCOME TO PCYNLITX NOVA PLATFORM

The pcynlitx nova platform provides innovative solutions for C++ developers. The pcynlitx nova platform can generate C++ build scripts and/or make files automaticly for your C++ projects. More specifically, the ide platform can determine the dependencies of the C++ project's source files by means of a meta program. Therefore, differently from the existing technologies, on the pcynlitx build system generation, there is no need to specify each file and/or directory dependency and dependency lists are created by the platform automatically. In each pcynlitx nova build system construction process, everything is performed from the graphical user interface and pcynlitx nova kernel. You donâ€™t need to write any code or configuration file for build system configuration. The only thing which is necessary is to specify the directories in which the headers, the source files and the libraries can be found. In addition to this, you must also show the location of the git repository to the pcynlitx platform and the location in which the new build system to be constructed.
